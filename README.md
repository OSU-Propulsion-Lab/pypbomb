For when you want the detonation to stay on the *inside*.

This package was made to help with the design of a closed-end detonation tube, and was written as part of my PhD research in the [propulsion lab](http://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/blunckgroup/propulsion-laboratory) at Oregon Sate University.
